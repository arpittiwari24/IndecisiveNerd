# Indecisive Nerd

A project to help indecisive people make decisons based on people's opinions . People can simply put their scenario/situation and then people can upvote or downvote in favour of two opinions , while being completely anonymous ( basically for shy and introvert people who think a lot about what will people say if they ask these type of questions on traditional social media) .
